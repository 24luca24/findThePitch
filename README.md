# **FindThePitch**  
An application to easily find and share football, basketball, padel, beach volleyball, and other sports pitches.  

## **The Idea**  
FindThePitch was born in **summer 2024**, during a hot August day when my friends and I were searching for a free football field to play on. After struggling to find one, we realized: *why not create an app where users can share and discover local sports pitches?* That’s when the idea took shape.  

## **Development Journey**  
A friend from university and I saw the break between exams and the start of the new semester as an opportunity—not just a pause, but a chance to build something useful. Instead of letting that time go to waste, we started developing **FindThePitch** to solve a real problem for sports enthusiasts.  

## **How It Works**  
At first, the application will be **empty**, except for a few pitches added by us (the creators! 😃). But as more users join, the database will grow, making it easier for everyone to find places to play.  

To make the app more **inclusive**, we expanded it beyond football to include other sports like basketball, padel, and beach volleyball. Our focus was on creating a **clean, intuitive interface** that makes pitch discovery and sharing effortless.  

- **Logged-in users** can search for sports pitches in their area or contribute by adding new ones.  
- **Guest users** can browse available pitches but won’t be able to add new locations.  

## **Helping Sports Venues & Field Booking Services**  
FindThePitch is not just for players—it’s also a great **visibility tool** for **sports venues, local gyms, and field booking services**. Businesses that offer **paid or reservable sports fields** can list their locations in the app, making it easier for potential customers to find and book their facilities.  

By being part of the **FindThePitch** community, these services can:  
✔️ **Reach more players** actively searching for a place to play  
✔️ **Increase their visibility** in the local sports scene  
✔️ **Provide updated info** on availability, pricing, and bookings  

Whether it’s a **public pitch or a private venue**, this app helps **connect players with the best places to play!** 🏆
